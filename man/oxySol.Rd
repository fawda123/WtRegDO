\title{Dissolved oxygen at saturation}
\usage{
oxySol(t, S, P = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{tem temperature, degrees C}

\item{S}{salinity, on the Practical Salinity Scale}

\item{P}{pressure, atm}
}
\value{
Dissolved oxygen concentration in mg/L at 100\% saturation. If \code{P = NULL}, saturation values at 1 atm are calculated.
}
\description{
Finds dissolved oxygen concentration in equilibrium with water-saturated air. Function and documentation herein are from archived wq package: \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wq/index.html}
}
\details{
Calculations are based on the approach of Benson and Krause (1984), using Green and Carritt's (1967) equation for dependence of water vapor partial pressure on \code{t} and \code{S}. Equations are valid for temperature in the range 0-40 C and salinity in the range 0-40.

\examples{
# Convert DO into \% saturation for 1-m depth at Station 32.
# Use convention of expressing saturation at 1 atm.

sfb1 <- subset(sfbay, depth == 1 & stn == 32)
dox.pct <- with(sfb1, 100 * dox/oxySol(temp, sal))
