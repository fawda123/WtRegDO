\description{
Evaluate metabolism results before and after weighted regression
}
\details{
This function provides summary statistics of metabolism results to evaluate the effectiveness of weighted regression. Summary statistics include the correlation of dissolved oxygen time series with predicted tidal height change, the correlation of metabolism estimates with mean tidal height change between observations during day or night periods for production and respiration (respectively), mean and standard deviation of metabolism estimates across all daily integrated values, and percent `anomalous' estimates of metabolism.

Statistics are estimated for the dissolved oxygen time series in the input dataset specified by the user (observed or filtered), whereas summary  before and after use of weighted regression and metabolism estimates based

In general, useful results for weighted regression are those that remove the correlation of dissolved oxygen, production, and respiration with tidal changes.  Similarly, the mean estimates of metabolism should not change, whereas the standard deviation and percent anomalous should decrease.

Tables 2 and 3 in Beck et al. 2015 were created using similar functions.
